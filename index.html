        <h2> Nature Therapy</h2>
        <p> Nature therapy is like a dream relationship loving, respectful and equal.Its not just about spending lots
            of time
            together. Its about what your partner gives you, and what you give your partner in return. When one half of
            the partnership begins to change for the worse, you work together to fix it. Otherwise, the unthinkable
            happens the end of something really magical.The climate emergency shows our relationship with nature is
            broken, but breaking up with our planet isn't an
            option. There is no Planet B. To fix it we need a new, more connected relationship that recognises we are
            nature. This is where nature therapy and nature connectedness come in. Research shows nature connectedness,
            which is our relationship with the world around us, improves physical
            and mental health, and above all, encourages pro-environmental behaviours..</p>

        <h2> Connecting with Nature</h2>
        <p>The world is animated by the wind. This invisible, mysterious force can bring a landscape alive. Its absence
            can cast a calm stillness over the earth. On barren mountain tops its power is barely perceptible; in
            forests and seas its presence becomes manifest.

            Winds are wild, and sometimes destructive. When we look deeply into the nature of wind, when we reflect on
            its life, its journey to us, we can see the interconnected nature of all things. The light from the sun
            travels to the surface of the earth, where air is heated unevenly over land and sea causing it to expand and
            rise at different rates until this rising and displacing air builds in billowing gusts that rock the oceans
            and ripple the seas. The wind can make rag-dolls of trees, ripping them from their roots.

            The beauty of the wind is its dynamism. It is not constant, nor predictable. One minute it lifts the place;
            the next there is a lull of still abiding peace. On gentle days it is god's whisper; In more rambunctious
            form it is a monster's roar, a voice that erupts with a wild and angry energy.</p>

        <h2> The Hug of Homecoming</h2>
        <p> Ln a very real sense, mountains and valleys, the seas and the skies, the sun and the earth, the trees and
            the flowers constitute our home, our natural habitat.

            Growing up in the modern developed world we can easily come to believe that towns and cities the urban and
            artificial environment is where we naturally belong. But our brains and bodies, which evolved over
            thousands of years, were designed by and designed for an environment very different to the one we live in
            now.

            Throughout our evolutionary history we lived in very close connection to the land, with a very close kinship
            with other creatures. Our physiological system evolved to survive in wild, natural environments and
            developed a love and kinship for these places that lives on in our DNA.

            This connection with the land combined with the kinship we would have felt with other living things that
            shared the land as their home has hardwired in us a strong sense of the natural world as 'home', and the
            importance of connection with all of life as being essential to our well-being.</p>
